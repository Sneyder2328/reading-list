## UI Components
- Always use shadcn/ui components for any UI elements
- Import components from `@/components/ui/` (e.g., `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`)
- Use the `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils` for combining Tailwind classes
- Follow shadcn component patterns: forwardRef, displayName, proper TypeScript types
- Prefer existing shadcn components over custom implementations
- For shared components across apps, use `packages/ui`

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow the established design system and color scheme
- Use responsive design patterns consistently

## Project Structure
- Keep components organized in `src/components/`
- Use the established folder structure for new features
- Follow TypeScript best practices throughout

## Code Quality
- Use proper TypeScript types
- Follow React best practices
- Maintain consistent code formatting (biome.json)
